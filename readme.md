Financial Data Analysis & Visualization for SEE SIGHT TOUR

1) Project Overview:
We utilized Power BI to analyze and visualize financial data for "SEE SIGHT TOUR", a travel company, to assess their money flow, revenue trends, and financial performance. The goal was to transform raw, unstructured data into actionable insights through interactive dashboards.

2) Data Challenges
The raw dataset had several issues that required cleaning before analysis:
Missing Data: Significant gaps in records affected accuracy.
Duplicate Entries: Redundant records skewed calculations.
Incorrect Values: Negative revenue entries and outliers led to potential miscalculations.

3) Data Processing & Cleaning
Before visualization, we performed data wrangling to ensure reliability:
Removed duplicates to maintain data integrity.
Handled missing values through filtering and corrections.
Corrected anomalies (e.g., negative revenue entries).
Made some extra columns that could help us calculate.

4) Visualization & Insights
Using Power BIâ€™s analytical tools, we created an interactive dashboard to highlight:
Revenue Trends: Monthly/Yearly income flow.
Expense Analysis: Key cost drivers.
Regional Performance: Which locations generated the most revenue vs. which incurred losses.
The final dashboard simplifies financial assessment, allowing stakeholders to make data-driven decisions efficiently.
